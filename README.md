**ABOUT**


Hello Everyone or shall I say  Hello World to my fellow programmers  :technologist:
This is Webscraping project that covers the Top-Rated Anime Series (IMDb) which may be of use to those who enjoy watching them or are finding somewhere to start!

I decided to create this project because not only am I am currently learning Python, but my friend was actually stuck in what to watch on a friday night so I decided - "Hey, Why not put my Python skills into a real-case use" :bulb:
