# Webscraping the IMDb Top-Rated Anime Series :rocket:


<h3>ABOUT</h3>


Hello Everyone or shall I say Hello World to my fellow programmers  :technologist:

This is a Webscraping project that covers the Top-Rated Anime Series (IMDb) which may be of use to those who enjoy watching them or are finding somewhere to start!

This Repository includes an excel spreadsheet(.xlsx) that contains the anime list which the data was parsed from the webscraper.py that includes the code of grabbing the:

-Rankings

-Anime Name

-Anime Release Date

-Anime IMDb ratings

(the link will be at the bottom of this README file)



I decided to create this project because not only am I am currently learning Python, but my friend was actually stuck in what to watch on a friday night so I decided - "Hey, Why not put my Python skills into a real-case use" :bulb:

I really enjoyed creating this and it was very difficult in the start with all the syntaxes and Python-specific functions (due to transitioning from JavaScript), but after alot of researching and countless tutorials , I finally got an end result ! 

Nevertheless, I really did enjoy this project and I learned alot from it so I hope whoever may use or see this, please feel free to use my code as I wrote comments to guide ! :open_hands:
