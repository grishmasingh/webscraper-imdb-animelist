The excel spreadsheet **(.xlsx)** that contains the anime list which the data was parsed from using the Beautiful Soup package in the **scraper.py** that includes the code of grabbing the:

 :trophy: Rankings

 :name_badge: Anime Titles

 :calendar: Anime Release Dates

 :star2: Anime IMDb Ratings :star2:


I decided to create this project because not only am I currently learning Python, but my friend was actually stuck on what to watch on a friday night so I decided - "Hey, Why not put my Python skills into a real-case use" :bulb:

I really enjoyed creating this and learned alot from it although it was difficult in the start with all the syntaxes and Python-specific functions (due to transitioning from JavaScript), but after alot of researching and countless tutorials - I finally got an end result ! 

Nevertheless, I hope whoever may use and see this, please feel free to use my code as I wrote comments to guide ! :open_hands:
